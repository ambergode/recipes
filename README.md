TODO:
- register
- make convert_unit actually do something
- Toggle on navbar not working
- On shopping list page: add button to switch types of units (metric to imperial)
- switch search on index to ajax
- Add nutrition info to detail page (maybe some to main page)
- make "add ingredients" a pop-up off of edit recipe
- Add "create regular shopping list" page
- Finish formatting edit recipe
- on index: buttons to display all public recipes, personal recipes, favorites
- detail page - multiply recipe - and have that go to shopping list
- put multiply recipe on card as well (instead of add to list? # in list: default 0)
- if 0 as quantity in recipe: ask user if actually desired
- add data validation to all forms
- add edit ingredient
- delete recipe from edit page
- make cards fill all possible space - turn direction to cols instead of rows?
- make recipes and ingredients that users add private to their accounts
- add recipe circles so users can share recipes with a group (upper level function: be part of mulitple groups)

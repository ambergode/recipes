Things to fix/change:
- Toggle on navbar not working
- Get rid of submit for form on recipe cards
- On shopping list page: add button to switch types of units (metric to imperial)
- When a user has searched the index and then adds a recipe to a list, the search is lost - make the search persistent - use javascript to record lists
- Add nutrition info to detail page (maybe some to main page)
- Add "add ingredients"  page
- Add "create regular shopping list" page
- Finish adding edit recipe
- Use fetch to index
- Like button on recipes - index just displays favorites
- detail page - multiply recipe - and have that go to shopping list
- put multiply recipe on card as well (instead of add to list? # in list: default 0)
- edit/add recipe - dynamically add more rows for ingredients or steps
- add data validation to all forms
- photo no longer showing up on edit or index pages
- remove button for ingredient on recipe
- figure out how to make a javascript button that onclick removes something from the database
- add edit ingredient
- Picture no longer link on index page

TODO:
- login/logout/register
- Toggle on navbar not working
- On shopping list page: add button to switch types of units (metric to imperial)
- When a user has searched the index and then adds a recipe to a list, the search is lost - make the search persistent - use javascript to record lists
- Add nutrition info to detail page (maybe some to main page)
- make "add ingredients" a pop-up off of edit recipe
- Add "create regular shopping list" page
- Finish formatting edit recipe
- Use fetch to index
- Like button on recipes - index just displays favorites
- detail page - multiply recipe - and have that go to shopping list
- put multiply recipe on card as well (instead of add to list? # in list: default 0)
- if 0 as quantity in recipe: ask user if actually desired
- add data validation to all forms
- add edit ingredient
- delete recipe from edit page
- make cards fill all possible space - turn direction to cols instead of rows?
